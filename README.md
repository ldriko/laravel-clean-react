# Laravel Clean React

## Introduction

A minimalist Laravel starter kit with Inertia.js, React, and Shadcn UI, providing a clean foundation without the clutter of authentication and other default scaffolding.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Node.js 18+ (LTS version recommended)
- Composer

## Installation

Create a new project using Laravel's installer:

```bash
laravel new --using=ldriko/laravel-clean-react
```

Once installed, you'll have a clean Laravel project with React, Inertia.js, and Shadcn UI configured and ready to useâ€”without any of the default authentication scaffolding or demo pages that come with the standard Laravel starter kit.
